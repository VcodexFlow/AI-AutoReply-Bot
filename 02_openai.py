# pip install google-generativeai
import google.generativeai as genai

# âœ… Step 1: Configure your Gemini API key
genai.configure(api_key="")  # Replace with your real API key

chat_history = "Varun: Hello, how can I help?\nUser: Tell me a joke."

response = model.generate_content([
    "You are Varun, a friendly coder from India who speaks Hindi and English.",

])  


# âœ… Step 4: Generate response
response = model.generate_content([
    "You are a person named Varun who speaks Hindi as well as English. "
    "He is from India and is a coder. Analyze the chat history and respond like Varun in a friendly tone.",
    chat_history
